# Construct‑IQ — Business Plan (Concise)

## Market
- **Who**: mid‑market General Contractors, specialty subs (MEP/envelope/interiors), suppliers, estimators.
- **Where**: start FL/TX/CA metros; expand to 10–15 priority states.
- **Why now**: fragmented procurement portals, tighter margins, and pressure to bid faster with fewer estimators.

## Offer (Plans & Pricing)
- **Starter** — $99/mo + $29/seat: search, saved filters, alerts, limited exports.
- **Pro** — $299/mo + $59/seat: takeoff + bid composer, unlimited exports, custom templates.
- **Org** — $999/mo base + $59/seat: multi‑org, SSO, audit logs, API access, FOIA concierge credits.
- **Add‑ons**: State/DOT packs; FOIA concierge; historical award datasets.

## GTM
- Beachhead verticals: **flooring/epoxy/polish**, **MEP**, **roofing/envelope**.
- Lead engines: targeted demo reels, bid‑board integrations, Slack communities, partner SPIFs (supply houses).

## Sales motion
1. Self‑serve trial (14–30 days) → in‑product prompts to import a project.
2. “White‑glove bid” button for done‑for‑you first win.
3. Hand‑off to customer success + template library subscription.

## Org plan (first 6–9 months)
- 2 engineers (API/harvest + UI), 1 data adapter contractor, 1 solutions (estimating), 0.5 marketing, 0.5 ops/CS.

## KPIs
- M1: 50 trials, 8 paid orgs.
- M3: 200 trials, 40 paid orgs, churn < 3%.
- M6: 500 trials, 120 paid orgs, NRR ≥ 115%.
