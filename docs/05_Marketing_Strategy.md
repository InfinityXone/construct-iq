# Marketing Strategy

## ICP & positioning
- ICP tiers: (1) flooring/epoxy/polish, (2) MEP, (3) roofing/envelope.
- Position as “earliest reliable signals + fastest bid workflow for small teams.”

## Channels
- **Foundational**: website demo reels, SEO pages per trade & state, case studies.
- **Targeted**: LinkedIn lead forms to estimators/PMs; Slack/Discord trade groups.
- **Partnerships**: supply houses & manufacturer reps (SPIFs per demo/show).

## Content
- Weekly “Signals Report” by state/vertical.
- “Bid in 10 minutes” live streams (recordings become ads).
- Templates library: takeoff packs, bid composer presets.

## Lifecycle
- Trial onboarding checklist; first win offer (done‑for‑you bid).
- Re‑engagement emails for stale trials; NPS + referral loop at day 30.
