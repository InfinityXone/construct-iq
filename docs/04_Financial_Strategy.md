# Financial Strategy

## Pricing & unit economics (assumptions)
- ARPA (org base + seats): $350/mo average in first 6 months.
- Gross margin ≥ 85% (cloud + data costs modest at early scale).
- CAC via targeted outreach: $400–$800; payback target < 4 months.
- Churn ≤ 3% monthly logo; NRR ≥ 115% by month 9 (upsell seats + add‑ons).

## Cash plan
- Keep burn < $25k/mo for first 6 months (2 eng, 0.5 mkt, 0.5 ops).
- Prioritize annual prepay discounts (‑10%) for runway extension.

## Milestone gates
- Gate 1 (M1): 8 orgs → unlock 1 adapter contractor.
- Gate 2 (M3): 40 orgs → expand adapters to 10 portals.
- Gate 3 (M6): 120 orgs → hire 1 dedicated CS, 1 AE.
